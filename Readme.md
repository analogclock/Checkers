# DESCRIPTION
This is a simple checkers game. 

# How to play checkers
1. Players can move on diagonals only
2. If not capturing, they can move one square in the forward (from the player's prespective) direction.
3. If there is an opponent piece next to your piece on the diagonal, you may capture it by jumping over it.
4. If any of your pieces reaches the opposite end of the board (your oppoenent's side), your piece will automatically become a Plus piece. Plus pieces can move and capture on all four diagonals.
5. The game ends and the application closes when either side has no more pieces.
